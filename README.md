## Week 1 Learning Tasks and Outcomes
* **Linear Regression from Scratch:** Built a basic linear regression model using NumPy, fitted it to a dataset, and plotted the regression line, enhancing understanding of regression fundamentals.
* **Data Cleaning:** Performed missing value imputation, outlier detection/removal, and data normalization/standardization with Pandas to improve data quality.
* **Feature Selection:** Implemented a correlation matrix and mutual information analysis to identify important features and visualized them effectively.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted EDA using Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover patterns and generate insightful visualizations.
* **Dimensionality Reduction:** Applied PCA to reduce dataset dimensionality and visualized results in 2D/3D, mastering data compression techniques.
